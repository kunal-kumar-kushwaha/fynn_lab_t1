# Market Segmentation Case Study: McDonald's Replication in Python

This README file provides an overview of the market segmentation case study conducted by our team. The study involved replicating the McDonald's case study using Python, covering various aspects of market segmentation fundamentals. 

## Summary of Fundamentals of Market Segmentation

During the 10-day study period, i covered the following key topics and concepts related to market segmentation:

1. Introduction to Market Segmentation: Understanding the importance and benefits of market segmentation in strategic marketing.
2. Types of Market Segmentation: Exploring different approaches to segmenting markets, including demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and geographic segmentation.
3. Data Preparation and Exploration: Learning how to preprocess and explore data to gain insights into customer segments.
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization of customer data.
5. K-means Clustering: Implementing K-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer segments.
6. Evaluation and Analysis: Assessing the identified segments based on various variables and metrics.

## Replication of McDonald's Case Study in Python

As part of the individual task, each team member replicated different parts of the McDonald's case study using Python. The code snippets provided in this repository showcase the replication efforts and demonstrate the application of market segmentation techniques to the McDonald's dataset.

Below is an overview of the code files included in this repository:

1. `data_preparation.ipynb`: Code for data preprocessing and exploration.
2. `pca_analysis.ipynb`: Code for applying PCA to the dataset and visualizing the principal components.
3. `kmeans_clustering.ipynb`: Code for implementing K-means clustering and analyzing the resulting segments.
4. `segment_evaluation.ipynb`: Code for evaluating and analyzing the identified segments based on different variables.

Please refer to each individual code file for detailed explanations and comments on the respective analyses.

## Usage

To run the code and replicate the analyses, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open each code file in a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn) are installed.
4. Execute the code cells in sequential order, following any instructions or comments provided within the files.

Note: The code files are intended for educational and practice purposes only. Feel free to modify or enhance the code as per your requirements.
