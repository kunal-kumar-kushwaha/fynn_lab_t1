The dataset used in this market segmentation case study is based on fast food customer data,specifically focusing on the McDonald's chain.
The dataset contains various attributes related to customer behavior and preferences,allowing us to analyze and segment the customer base.


The dataset includes information such as visit frequency, customer likes, gender, and other relevant variables. 
These variables provide insights into customer engagement, preferences, and demographic characteristics, enabling 
us to identify distinct customer segments based on their behaviors and characteristics.

By analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain a better understanding of McDonald's customer base and uncover meaningfulpatterns and insights
that can inform marketing strategies and decision-making. The dataset serves as a representative sample of fast food customers and 
provides a valuable resource for studying market segmentation in the context of the fast food industry.

Throughout the case study, we preprocess, explore, and analyze the dataset using various techniques such as data encoding, 
principal component analysis (PCA), and K-means clustering. These techniques help us identify and evaluate different
customer segments, allowing us to tailor marketing efforts and strategies to specific groups of customers based on
their unique characteristics and preferences.

It is important to note that the dataset used in this case study is for educational and practice purposes only
and may not reflect real-world data from McDonald's or other fast food chains. The focus is on demonstrating the
application of market segmentation techniques using a representative dataset in the fast food industry.
